    "## 1.1 Introduction\n",
    "A snowplow must clean the snow in front of n houses, n ∈N. The position of\n",
    "each house is represented by a float number (not necessary positive), hence we as-\n",
    "sume that all houses are on a given one dimensional road.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the snowplow is in 0. The traveling time of the snowplow is equivalent to\n",
    "the distance that it went through since the beginning of the day. If there are several\n",
    "houses at the same point, it does not take a longer time to clean the snow (the snow\n",
    "is cleaned as soon as the snowplow has passed). However, since the positions of the\n",
    "houses are represented as floats, this won’t happen (with a very high probability).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The snowplow must minimize the average waiting time of the houses, before\n",
    "the snow is cleaned in front of their doorstep. This minimization is from the point\n",
    "of view of the houses (and not from the point of view of the snowplow). The total\n",
    "distance traveled by the snowplow is not relevant itself."

    "## 1.2 Exercise\n",
    "1) Propose a n ∈N(it does not need to be large n = 10 is fine) and a configuration\n",
    "of the houses where the optimal order of cleaning is not obtained by either :\n",
    "    - sorting the houses positions and cleaning them in that order.\n",
    "    - going to the closest house at each time step.\n",
    "2) Propose and implement a polynomial-time algorithm (in terms of the number\n",
    "of houses) based on the positions of the houses, in order to clean the snow. If it is\n",
    "not polynomial (if it is exponential for example) we saw in class that it would not\n",
    "be able to be run in a reasonable time."
